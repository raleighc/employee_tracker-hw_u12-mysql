# Employee Tracker

![Employee Tracker](./assets/images/employee_tracker.png)

## Description

This application allows the user to build a database of employees and their relevant information.

## Usage

To begin, the user must first run "npm install inquirer", "npm install mysql", and "npm install console.table". Then enter "node server.js" in the command line to begin the application.
The user will want building their team by first creating a department then creating roles assigned to that department, then finally employees assigned to those roles. After populating their table, the user can then manager their table with add and remove functions for each category. As they make changes they can view all departments, all roles, employees by department, or all employees which contains all associated information connected to each employee. Upon completion the user will select "Exit" to terminate their connection to the database and close the application.

## Creating This Page

For this project, I built a database using MySql and then built an Inquirer driven Command Line Application which pulls from and stores information in my database. This project was a challenge at every step. The snowball effect never really kicked in as new problems popped up on every new function that was created.
